This repository contains two scripts for preparing the Raven inputs using the Hydrotel model inputs created by Physitel. There are two scripts that need to be run in sequence: first one is Hydrotel_Raven.py which creates the subwatershed map and then HRU_threshold which takes the created subwatershed map to delineate the HRU map based on land use and soil map of the watershed. There is also a possibility of running an HRU aggregation algorithm (land use surface area smaller than the threshold will be converted to the dominant land use class at the subwatershed scale). This is hard coded at 5%. but it can change as desire.
